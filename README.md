## Data Structures: Objects and Arrays

### Arrays

Like other arrays... with []

With methods like

* push (with variable arguments)
* pop
* join

### Properties

Classic fields, available through dot notation and square brackets (metaprogramming!)

### Objects

* With {}
* You can delete a property (very uncommon)
* And check with if a property exists *in*
* Existing values in JS (numbers, strings and booleans) are immutable.
